# Transmission-Distribution-models
*** Before working with the given .mo file(s) in OpenModelica, please load the `PowerSystems 0.6.0` library.

1) We aim to build a basic Micro-grid transmission-distribution model in OpenModelica based on the given block diagram in pdf format.

2) Please open the 'subModels' folder and download the 'TransmissionDistributionModels.mo' package from the repository and then open it with OMEdit.

3) The package is containing three modelica files: `subModelGeneric`(generic model), `subModel1ph`(1 phase model) and `subModel3ph`(3 phase model). Each of the files is a test model for the proposed full transmission-distribution model.

`Notes:-` "subModelGeneric" and "subModel1ph" models are simulatable. Descriptions about the models can be seen clicking `document view` in case of each model. Please wait until the simulation is completed 100%. Screenshots of simulation results of those models are added to the 'subModels' folder in the repository. For the "subModel3ph" model, we are currently facing some simulation problem due to some improper parameters of the components used. We are working on it and will update once it is resolved.
