# Transmission-Distribution-models
***Before working with the given .mo file(s) in OpenModelica, please load the following libraries- 'Buildings latest' and 'PowerSystems 0.6.0'.

1) We aim to build a basic Micro-grid transmission-distribution model in OpenModelica based on the given block diagram in pdf format.

2) Please open the 'subModels' folder and download the 'TransmissionDistributionModels.mo' package from the repository and then open it with OMEdit.

3) The package is containing three modelica files: "subModelGeneric", "subModel1ph" and "subModel3ph". Each of the files is a test model for the proposed full transmission-distribution model.

Notes:- "subModelGeneric" and "subModel1ph" models are working fine with a certain amount of simulation time. Please wait until the simulation is completed 100%. Screenshots of simulation results of those models are added to the 'subModels' folder in the repository. For the "subModel3ph" model, we are currently facing some initialization problem. We are working on it and will update once it is resolved.
